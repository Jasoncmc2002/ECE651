Every repository member should set up his own branch at the beginning of each sprint 
and at the end of the sprint, back-end and front-end members should merge their own subbranch into corresponding dev sprint branch.
For example, a back-end developer named Jason will create his own backend develop branch named "backend-dev-Jason-sprint1" 
when sprint 1 begins and at the end of sprint 1, he will merge his branch into "back-end-dev-sprint1" on the meeting of discussing merging branches.
The master branch will only changed after a stable version,a version after comprehensive tests, is released.
